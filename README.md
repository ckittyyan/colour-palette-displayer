# Overview

Colour Palette Display is a simple web application that features the following:
- a horizontal scrollable list of photos fetched from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos with
    - the title of each photo written diagonally across the photo
    - each photo displayed with rounded corners, a thin white border, and a subtle drop shadow
    - cached with [localForage](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/)
- a "Shuffle" Button that reorders the list of photos recursively
- a changing title colour (when the page refreshes)
